# GitHub-user-finder
an app to search for github users.

This app is part of "Modern JavaScript from the beginning" course by Traversy Media. I have made some changes to the app to have it function more the way I like it, eg. search doesn`t get fired by a keyup event but rather by the search button. Also styling is updated here and there.
